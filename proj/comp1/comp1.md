The goal of the competition on [Kaggle][Kaggle] platform was to build an algorithm that identifies which camera model captured a given image by using traces intrinsically left in the raw image.


The list of camera models for the challenge:

* Sony NEX-7
* Motorola Moto X
* Motorola Nexus 6
* Motorola DROID MAXX
* LG Nexus 5x
* Apple iPhone 6
* Apple iPhone 4s
* HTC One M7
* Samsung Galaxy S4
* Samsung Galaxy Note 3

The final result of participation: the __15th__ place out of 582 teams (__top-3%__, Kaggle silver megal).
