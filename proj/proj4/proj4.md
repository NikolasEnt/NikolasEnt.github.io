Originally, this Project was based on the twelfth task of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program. The main goal of the project is to train an artificial neural network for semantic segmentation of a video from a front-facing camera on a car in order to mark road pixels with Tensorflow (using the [KITTI][kitti] dataset).

Additianally, multiclass semantic segmentation for the [Cityscapes][cityscapes] was added.
