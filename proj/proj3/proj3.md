The Udacity Self-Driving Car Challenge #3.

My (a.k.a. RoboCar team) results and ideas for the Challenge are presented here.
The solution is based on Deep Learning and realized the "Localization as Classification approach" with GoogLeNet artificial neural networks. The approach took the 3d place on the final [leaderboard](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/tree/master/challenges/challenge-3).

Details on this Challenge can be found [here](https://medium.com/udacity/challenge-3-image-based-localization-5d9cadcff9e7#.cv1xx261f).
