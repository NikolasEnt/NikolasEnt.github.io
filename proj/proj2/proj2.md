This Project is based on the fifth task of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program. The main goal of the project is to a software pipeline to identify vehicles in a video from a front-facing camera on a car. Additionally, a [Lane Line finding](/proj/proj1) algorithm was added

It was implemented in Python with OpenCV and Scikit-learn libraries. Linear SVM was used as a classifier for HOG, binned color and color histogram features. The project [repo](https://github.com/NikolasEnt/Vehicle-Detection-and-Tracking).
