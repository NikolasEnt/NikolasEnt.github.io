## __Welcome!__

Welcome! My name is Nikolay Falaleev, and I am a self-driving car enthusiast. Robotics and artificial intelligence in general has been my dream since I was young because I believe that these fields will play a key role in virtually every aspect of our future life.

Cars are among the best-fit fields of such technologies application. Most people spend hours every day commuting. Self-Driving cars can help to use this time for business or rest. In addition, autonomous vehicles can potentially reduce fatalities on roads.

I am sure that classical fundamental education is crucial to be well prepared to meet all the challenges of the modern fast-changing, but fascinating, world. I have successfully completed my master degree at the Department of Material Science at Lomonosov Moscow State University in Russia. I selected the program because it is offered at the best university in the country and it provided outstanding fundamental interdisciplinary education in Mathematics, Mechanics, Physics, Chemistry, and Computer Sciences.

I believe that I have to be engaged in self-development in my chosen area, that is why I am taking many massive open online courses in computer science and data analysis including courses on robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. The last and most comprehensive one is the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree by Udacity. My thoughts and ideas on some of the educational projects from the Nanodegree form the core of this blog. From my perspective, another important and very instructive activity for self-education in these modern areas is participating in a variety of Data Science competitions. So, discussions of [challenges][challenges], as well as useful ideas and tips, which could be used in Computer Vision or Deep Learning projects, posted on the website.
