## __Welcome!__

Hi! My name is _Nikolay Falaleev_  and I am a self driving car enthusiast. Robotics in general has been my dream since I was young because I believe that robots and artificial intelligence will play a key role in virtually every aspect of our future life. 

Cars are among the best fit fields of these technologies application. Most people spend  hours every day commuting. Self-Driving cars can help to use this time for business or rest. In addition, autonomous vehicles can potentially reduce fatalities on roads.

I am absolutely sure that classical fundamental education is crucial to be well prepared to meet all challenges of the modern fast-changing, but fascinating, world. I have successfully completed my [master degree][cv] at the Department of Material Science at Lomonosov Moscow State University in Russia. I selected the program because it is offered at the best university in the country and the program provided outstanding fundamental interdisciplinary education in Mathematics, Mechanics, Physics, Chemistry and Computer Sciences.

I believe that I have to be engaged in self-development in my chosen area, that is why I am taking many massive open online courses in computer science and data analysis including courses on robotics, computer vision and machine learning. The last and most comprehensive one is the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree by [Udacity]. My thoughts and ideas on some of the educational [projects] from the Nanodegree form the core of this blog. 

I also completed a lot of robotics-related independent DIY projects. Most of them was about building and coding ground rovers or flying vehicle able to perform tasks autonomously. My most advanced independent project which was related to an unmanned aerial vehicle, was a quadcopter-like fully autonomous flying vehicle for indoor operation. It was able to find the path to a goal in an unknown environment using only onboard sensors and computers, so there was no need for communication with a ground station, which might be essential in some cases.
