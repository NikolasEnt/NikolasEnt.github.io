## __Hello!__

I’m Nikolay Falaleev, a Deep Learning Researcher and an experienced Leader with a strong passion for real-time multi-modal multi-task pipelines, mainly in the areas of perception, dynamic forecasting and other embodied AI systems. My fascination with robotics and artificial intelligence has been a driving force throughout my career and entire life, as I envision the transformative impact these technologies will have on our future.

I firmly believe in the importance of classical fundamental education to be well prepared to meet all the challenges of the modern fast-changing but fascinating world. I completed my Master’s degree at Lomonosov Moscow State University’s Department of Materials Science with honours with grade 5.0/5.0. This fundamental interdisciplinary program provided me with a robust foundation in Mathematics, Mechanics, Physics, Chemistry and Computer Sciences, along with hands-on experience in data processing from experimental observations and vast academic research experience. To stay at the forefront of this rapidly evolving field, I continuously pursue learning through Summer Schools and MOOCs.

In addition to education, I am actively involved in independent projects, academic research on AI and lecturing. I regularly participate in Data Science [competitions][challenges] and share insights and tips for tackling real-world challenges in Computer Vision and Deep Learning. My contributions are detailed on the blog, which serves as a platform for sharing educational projects and discussing innovative ideas.

Professionally, I have led significant advancements at various companies, mainly driving the development of real-time AI systems for sports analytics and AR/VR broadcasting. These experiences have honed my ability to lead cross-functional teams in delivering cutting-edge solutions that are both scalable and commercially viable.

My journey is not just professional but deeply personal. I’m passionate about authonomous vehicles, deep learning, computer vision, robotics, artificial intelligence and mathematical modelling. Beyond my work, I contribute to research and open-source AI projects on [GitHub][github].

I look forward to continuing my journey of innovation and exploration in these exciting fields.

Feel free to connect with me if you’d like to discuss any topics further.
