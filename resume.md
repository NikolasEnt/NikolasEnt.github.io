Spearheaded projects that replaced human scouting with automated, highly accurate CV solutions, driving significant cost savings and enhancing data quality for betting, coaching, and broadcast applications. 

* **Pioneered a real-time spatio-temporal video processing architecture**, published in a [CVPR 2020 paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2020/html/w53/Voeikov_TTNet_Real-Time_Temporal_and_Spatial_Video_Analysis_of_Table_Tennis_CVPRW_2020_paper.html). The system was showcased at high-profile events: [Tokyo 2020 Olympics](https://web.archive.org/web/20230607084409/https://tokyo2020.osai.ai/), [JOOLA North American Teams Championships](https://medium.com/@osai.ai/news-north-american-teams-championships-2021-to-live-stream-table-tennis-in-mixed-reality-powered-8f3da803b86f) and [National Table Tennis Championship 2020](https://medium.com/@osai.ai/osai-empowered-russian-table-tennis-championship-with-cv-and-ai-analytics-e7d52a6d8a5c), and has been deployed in numerous venues **worldwide for 24/7 commercial operation**. The system is **52% faster than humans, 40% cheaper and has accuracy above 97.5%**. [SBJ article](https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Daily/Issues/2022/12/27/Technology/osai-ai-machine-learning-computer-vision-table-tennis-microbetting-data-mixed-reality/).
* Architected and deployed Computer Vision modules for real-time video analysis of 100,000s of eSports tournaments monthly, including FIFA, NHL, and NBA.
* Led the end-to-end development of a Computer Vision module for pool-9 real-time analysis, overseeing the entire project from data collection to product deployment. This system delivered significant cost savings. [Video demo](https://youtu.be/KfQTzod34JE), [Blog article [rus]](https://habr.com/ru/company/constanta/blog/430030/).

__10/2014 - 07/2017__ __Junior Researcher__ _Academic Research Institute_

Developed and analyzed stable finite-difference schemes for modeling transient heat and mass transfer in three-dimensional geometries using C/C++. Contributed to six peer-reviewed scientific publications and presented findings at three conferences.
